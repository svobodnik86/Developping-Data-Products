Shiny apps
========================================================

- Shiny apps can bring the wisdom of R on the web
- Shiny - web desing meets data analysis!
- I present a simple yet enticing demo project 

Demo Project
========================================================

- I use data set "presidents"
- Popularity polls for American presidents have been conducted
for over 30 years 
- R can help us quickly analyze the data

Application
========================================================

The Shiny application App-Presidents has the following ingredients:

* select wiget to select a particular president
* radio button to decide whether we are interested in his
highs or lows
* it also renders the photo of a particular president

Conclusion
========================================================
With the use of Shiny, I created an app which analyzes 
when was a particular president popular and when he was not

Shiny technology enables an elegant way how to process data
with help of R in the background.
